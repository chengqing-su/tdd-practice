# TDD Practice Problems

A comprehensive collection of Test-Driven Development (TDD) practice problems organized by difficulty levels and frameworks to help programmers learn and master TDD techniques.

[中文版本](README_zh.md)

## 🎯 Purpose

This project aims to help new TDD learners quickly get started with practical exercises. Each problem includes:
- Clear problem description
- Example inputs and outputs
- Suggested test cases
- Step-by-step TDD guidance
- Multiple language implementations

## 🔥 What's New: Spring Boot TDD Problems!

We've added a comprehensive **Spring Boot TDD** section with problems specifically designed for web development, REST APIs, and microservices testing!

## 📊 Difficulty Levels

### 🟢 Easy
Perfect for TDD beginners. These problems focus on:
- Basic test writing
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Simple algorithms
- String manipulation
- Basic data structures

### 🟡 Medium
For developers with some TDD experience:
- More complex algorithms
- Object-oriented design
- Error handling
- Edge cases consideration

### 🔴 Hard
Advanced problems for experienced TDD practitioners:
- Complex system design
- Multiple interacting components
- Performance considerations
- Advanced design patterns

### 🌐 Spring Boot Problems
Framework-specific TDD problems for web development:
- **Beginner**: REST APIs, database integration, validation
- **Intermediate**: Complex business logic, security, caching
- **Advanced**: Microservices, distributed systems, event-driven architecture

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For General TDD Practice
1. Choose a difficulty level (Easy → Medium → Hard)
2. Pick a problem that interests you
3. Read the problem description carefully
4. Write your first failing test
5. Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
6. Compare with provided solutions

### For Spring Boot TDD
1. Start with [Spring Boot Beginner Problems](spring-boot/beginner/)
2. Learn web layer testing with MockMvc
3. Master data layer testing with @DataJpaTest
4. Progress to complex microservices scenarios
5. Practice with real databases using TestContainers
